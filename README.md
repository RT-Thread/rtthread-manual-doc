# RT-Thread

RT-Thread (Real-Time Thread) is an open source embedded real-time operating system and released under Apache License v2.0. It has a strong scalability: from a nano kernel running on a tiny MCU, for example ARM Cortex-M0, or Cortex-M3/4/7, to a rich feature system running on MIPS32, ARM Cortex-A, even the emerging open source RISC-V architecture is supported. RT-Thread can run either on single-core systems or on symmetric multi-core processors(SMP) systems.

## Introduction

RT-Thread has not noly a real-time kernel, but also rich components. Its architecture is as follows:

![RT-Thread system framework](figures/02Software_framework_diagram.png)

- **Kernel**: It includes preemptive multi-task real-time scheduler, and infrastructure such as semaphore, mutex, mailbox, message queue, signal, event, memory management, timer management, interrupt management, etc. It also includes libcpu/BSP (file related to chip transplantation/board support package).
- **components**: It is a software unit on the RT-Thread kernel layer, such as command line (FinSH), device driver framework (Device Drivers), network framework, virtual file system (FAT, YAFFS, UFFS, ROM/RAM file system, etc.), TCP/IP network protocol stack (lwIP), libc/POSIX standard layer and so on. Generally, a software component is placed in a folder in the RT-Thread/components directory, and each software component is described by a *SConscript* file and added to the RT-Thread construction system. When a software component is opened in the system configuration, it will be compiled and linked to the final RT-Thread firmware.
- **Packages**: It is a middleware running on RT-Thread IoT operating system platform and facing different application fields. Packages consist of description information, source code or library files. These packages can be provided by RT-Thread, third-party developers and enterprises, and the license agreement of the packages is provided by the author of the packages. These software packages have strong reusability and high modularity, which greatly facilitates application developers to build their desired application systems in the shortest time. For more package information, visit the [RT-Thread package repository](https://github.com/RT-Thread-packages).

# Source Code and Tools

**Get the source code**: The source code of RT-Thread is hosted on Github, and click on the link to get the source code.

- [Download RT-Thread source code](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread)

**Get the Env Tool**: To better help developers, the RT-Thread team also provides Env tools (or Env scripts for Linux/MacOS). On Windows, Env tool is a development assistant tool launched by RT-Thread. It provides compiling and building environment, graphical system configuration and software package management functions for project projects based on RT-Thread operating system. Its built-in menuconfig provides a simple and easy-to-use configuration tailoring tool, which can tailor the kernel, components and software packages freely, so that the system can be built in the way of building blocks.

# Getting Started

RT-Thread BSP can be compiled directly and downloaded to the corresponding development board for use. In addition, RT-Thread also provides qemu-vexpress-a9 BSP, which can be used without hardware platform. See the getting started guide below for details.
